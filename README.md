## Overview

ShopSmart is a web-based e-commerce application front-end prototype built with React. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases. It utilizes React Bootstrap for styling, React Router DOM for navigation, and SweetAlert2 for user-friendly notifications and alerts.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products fetched from a fake store API.
- **Product Details**: Shows detailed information about each product, including an image, description, price, and quantity selector.
- **Shopping Cart**: Enables users to add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- **Purchase Confirmation**: Provides a confirmation step before completing a purchase.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error pages for data fetching errors and non-existent routes.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Loading Indicators**: Uses spinners to indicate loading states while fetching data from the API.

## Purpose

The ShopSmart application was developed to demonstrate the use of React.js, context API for state management, and React Bootstrap for responsive UI components. It also aims to demonstrate and hone the usage of React Router DOM for navigation and React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
